# Velvet

heavily unfinished library

you can make games, tools, whatever

i was inspired by [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) and [LOVE2D](https://github.com/love2d/love). they're really great tools for making games and such but i wanted to do the same thing in C#. yes there is a C# binding for raylib, i've used that before

i lowk just wanted something that's cross-platform (for desktop at least). plus, it would be cool, right?

tbh idk if i'll finish this i'll just put this here for progress, if anyone wants to help out please do i am not great at C# :sob:

## things i'm done with

- basic window
- drawing rectangles, circles, any polygon you could think of, with color!
- input from keyboard and mouse
